Indy documentation 
=

This repository contains a COPY of the official indy documentation in HTML for the latest version available at the time of download, march 9, 2022, which was **Indy 10.1.5**

At the time of the repository creation, March 4, 2024, it appears there's no official documentation online, at least I couldn't find it, so I set up this repository and uploaded it to have it online using github pages.
